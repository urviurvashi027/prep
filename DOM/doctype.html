<!-- Doctype stands for Document Type Declaration. 
    It informs the web browser about the type and version of HTML used in building the web document. 
    This helps the browser to handle and load it properly. -->
<!-- HTML 4.01:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"> -->

<!-- In HTML 4.01, the DOCTYPE declaration refers to a document type definition (DTD). -->

<!-- Additionally, doctypes for HTML 4.01 r
    equired the declaration of either strict, transitional, or frameset DTD, each with a different use case as outlined below.

Strict DTD: Used for web pages that exclude attributes and elements that W3C expects to phase out as CSS support grows
Transitional DTD: Used for web pages that include attributes and elements that W3C expects to phase out as CSS support grows
Frameset DTD: Used for web pages with frames -->

<!-- Full standards mode renders pages according to the W3C web standards.
Quirks mode renders pages in a non standards compliant way.
Almost standards mode is close to full standards mode, but features support for a small number of quirks. -->

<!-- Modern browsers generally try to render HTML content according to the W3C recommendations. 
    However, to provide compatibility with older web pages, and to provide additional "intuitive" functionality, all browsers support an alternative "quirks mode".
    Quirks mode is not, however, a standard. The rendering of any page in quirks mode in different browsers may be different. 
    Whenever possible, it is better to adhere to the W3C standards and try and avoid depending on any past or present browser quirks.
Generally, quirks mode is turned on when there is no correct DOCTYPE declaration, and turned off when there is a DOCTYPE definition. 
However, invalid HTML - with respect to the chosen DOCTYPE - can also cause the browser to switch to quirks mode. -->

<!-- => If you don't use doctype, Quirks mode => providing support for (backward compatibility mode)
=> Tells about the type of document that is there. => XHTML, HTML4.1, HTML5
=> If not used, some of the latest features might not work properly -->
